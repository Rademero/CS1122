Seperate code into seprite files to keep organization
File class only hold the information of where the file is ex dirveLetter:/stat place/folder/folder/file
for big files you can do ex D:\\CS\\CS 1122\\Week 1 or D:/CS/CS 1122/Week 1
you can't edit or change with the file class, sepereation of concern
scanner can be used to read from a file with inp = new Scanner(system.in);   inp = new Scanner(new File("file new/path"); don't forget to import
you can use hasNext(),hasNextLine,hasNextint to question if there are next
nextByte(),nextShort,nextInt,next,nextLine can be used to get data
Short uses 8 bits, 16 bits for int, 32 bits for a long, doble has twice the bits flouts have
next just gets a word
CLOSE THE FILE AFTER YOU ARE DONE WITH THE PROGRAME with .close(); when working with files
Scanner in = newScanner(file);
while(in.hasNext()){
String myString = in.next()
}

for char
Scanner in = newScanner(file);
in.useDelimiter
while(in.hasNext()){
char myCar = in.next.charAt(o);
}

char test cases
isDigit - Boolean
isLetter - Boolean
isUpperCase - Boolean
isLowerCase - Boolean
isWhitespace - Boolean

Scanner in = newScanner(file);//Could be difficalteif used nextLine but doable 
while(in.hasNext()){
String myString = in.nextLine()
}

If you use nextInt could cause a mismatch exception 
to get aroun hasNextInt()

Scanner can be used to read from keyboard,string,file, and web page.Possibal others Scanner(URL)

WRITING TO A FILE
java.io.PrintWriter;
PrintWriter pwt = new PrintWriter (file);
for (Contact contact : list({
pwt.println(Cantact.getName());
pwt.println(cantact.getPhone());
}
pwt.close();


psvm is a short cut, so is ctrl j
