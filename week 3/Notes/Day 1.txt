contact list and contact entry program has a "has a" relationsship contactList has a-> contavt entry 
is-a relationship 
ex car -> is-a vheicle Inheritance relation
four pilars
Encapsulation- all data methods related to the thin being modeled should be contained within a class
Other classes should always use the class interface to use

Polymorphism- From one to many
The ablity to differentiate behavior between subtypes and parents in a class hierarchy



Abstraction-the prossess of generalizingg away from details
often talked about terms of information


Inheritance- Auttomatic reuse of data and functionality of a parent class, ability to form class hierarchies
ex animale-> mammal
    \>reptile
A superclass is a more generalized class
A subclass is a more speecilzed class, also uses all infomation from the master class
Java dosn't alow mulitiple inharetace, you would have to redefine the behaivors of the master classes
You want a single class that usese same method but diffrent values, no inharence for diffrent methods 
to indacate a inhaence you use public class subclass extends superclass
you redeclare to chage the behiovor of a method with an @overide 
private still can only be used by the superclass so use public getters and seters or pertected 
Don't redefine varieables is subclasses USE GETTERS AND SETERS
Overiding a method occurs when you need to change the behavior specifed in a superclass to use in a subclass, ex. ToString 
use the super keyword to directtly call a method in the superclass
ex. super.display//uses the display method from the superclass
you can have a method in your super class, and also overload for rhe same method name but diffrent perameters.
